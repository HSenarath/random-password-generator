# Random Password Generator 

A simple webpage that allows users to create a randomized password. This was an optional solo project from [Scrimba's JavaScript Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript/).

With my recent purchase of [1Password](https://1password.com/), a password manager service, I was inspired to take on this challenge to see how I could create a secure password by generating a random set of characters.

This also allowed me to utilize my newly acquired JavaScript skills to ensure that I could build a project without guidance.
